# GATETRAVEL
Our project aims to better the MRT traveling experience of many Singaporeans with just a few interactive GUI clicks. Not only does it provide the shortest route, it provides the option for the route with the least interchanges and provides the gate closest to the escalator at the exiting station. These functions would help both young and old when they are commuting via MRT. The shortest route would be the most ideal for the young adults as it allows them to find out the quickest possible way to get to their station and shows them the gates they should go to to get easy access to the escalators. The least interchanges option would be an excellent fit for the elderly and disabled as having few interchanges would be more convenient for them. By providing the gate closest to the escalator at the exiting station, commuters can wait at the corresponding gate in advance such that less time would be wasted waiting in a human jam. To conclude, our program would not only help the users cut down on traveling time and lesser walking, but it also allows users to be able to leave the station much quicker.
